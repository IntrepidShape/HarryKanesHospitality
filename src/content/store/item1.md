As part of my services, I've designed a short flyer called Eating Green, Lean, Cheap, and Keen Magazine "Green Zine". This short essay is a fun and quirky artistic venture that aims to inspire you to create delicious meals using leftovers, waste, weeds from your garden, and even your neighbor's lemon tree.

My goal is to empower you to embrace a self-sufficient lifestyle and reconnect with the roots of our food. To keep costs down, I've learned to store seeds, grow my own produce, and use techniques such as pickling, fermenting, and food scrap mulching.

Through insightful essays on food systems, tasty recipies, and everyday tips; Eating Green, Lean, Cheap, and Keen Magazine is a fantastic resource that can help you make small changes towards sustainability.
